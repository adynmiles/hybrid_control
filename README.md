# hybrid_control
 MATLAB code for hybrid magnetic and impulsive attitude control.

 - `continuous_dynamics.m`: Open-loop dynamics with gravity gradient and magnetic effects.
 - `continuous_control.m`: Proportional-derivative controller for continuous magnetic attitude control.
 - `continuous_lqr.m`: Linear quadratic regulator controller for continuous optimal magnetic attitude control.

 These programs are part of a Thesis Interim Report titled "Optimal Hybrid Magnetic and Impulsive Control for Earth-Observing Spacecraft"
