# hybrid_control
 MATLAB code for hybrid magnetic and impulsive attitude control.

 - `continuous_dynamics.m`: Open-loop dynamics with gravity gradient and magnetic effects.
 - `continuous_control.m`: Proportional-derivative controller for continuous magnetic attitude control.
 - `continuous_lqr.m`: Linear quadratic regulator controller for continuous optimal magnetic attitude control.
 - `hybrid_control.m`: Linear quadratic regulator controller for hybrid optimal magnetic and impulsive attitude control.
 - `hybrid_optimization.m`: Examination of a cost function to optimize number of impulses in hybrid model.
 - `hybrid_continuous_comparison.m`: Code for plotting continuous and hybrid control responses.

 These programs are part of a Thesis titled "Optimal Hybrid Magnetic and Impulsive Control for Earth-Observing Spacecraft"
